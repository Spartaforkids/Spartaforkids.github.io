      <h2>🛡️ Who Were the Spartans?</h2>
      <p>The Spartans were a fierce group of people from ancient Greece. Their city, Sparta, was famous for creating the best warriors of their time. Boys trained to become soldiers from a young age and lived by the values of courage, discipline, and strength.</p>

        <h2>👶 Training from Age 7</h2>
        <p>At just 7 years old, Spartan boys were taken from their families to join the <strong>Agoge</strong>—a tough training school. Here they learned to fight, survive in the wild, and never show fear. They ran barefoot, wore little clothing, and ate small meals to become tough.</p>

        <h2>⚔️ Spartan Armor & Weapons</h2>
        <p>Spartans wore bronze helmets, red cloaks, and carried large round shields called <strong>aspis</strong>. Their weapons included short swords and long spears. Their shields were so important that dropping one in battle was seen as a disgrace.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Bravery and Silence</h2>
      <p>Spartan warriors were trained to speak little but act bravely. They believed in doing more and saying less. This is where the word <em>“laconic”</em> comes from—it means saying a lot with just a few words!</p>
